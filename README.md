# Rust development environment setup

_Rust Bootcamp week 1: Setting up your development environment_

This week, you will learn how to optimize your Rust development workflow using powerful tools such as programming suggestions, prompts with Copilot, and GitHub Codespaces. By diving into the lessons on programming with suggestions, using prompts with Copilot, and exploring the fundamentals of Codespaces, you will acquire the skills to streamline your coding process and collaborate more efficiently with others.

This is the first week of the Rust Bootcamp. There are 4 weeks in total:

- [week 1](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-setup) ðŸ‘ˆ You are here!
- [week 2](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-fundamentals)
- [week 3](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-structs-types-enums/)
- [week 4](https://github.com/alfredodeza/applied-rust)

ðŸ’¡ Are you just looking for a ðŸ‘‰ [Rust template](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-template) to get started easily with a project? The [template](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-template) has everything you need!

## Is Rust difficult to learn?
Contrary to what some think, Rust is not actually more difficult to learn than other languages including Python and TypeScript. In fact, [Google gathered data from its own engineers to understand how difficult it is to learn Rust](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/06/rust-fact-vs-fiction-5-insights-from-googles-rust-journey-2022.html). The final report found that most engineers felt proficient in Rust in 2 months or less, where some would feel proficient in as little as 3 weeks!

## Contents
This week has several references to supporting content that can help you setup your environment. Make sure you have Rust installed and you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza).

This repository is [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) *ready*, and it is set as a template repository. You can create a new repository from this template and start working on your own with Codespaces. This means that Rust, Copilot, and all the extensions are already installed and configured for you.

:fire: If you need a quick reference for Codespaces and configuration with Visual Studio Code, feel free to reuse the [configuration files](./.devcontainer) in this repository.

### Lesson 4: Practice Lab

Use the [included lab](./lab.md) for this week to apply the concepts you've learned. The [lab](./lab.md) lab has 3 parts that are all relevant for what you've learned this week.

## Getting Started

This repository includes a sample Rust project to help you test your development environment setup. Follow these steps to build and run the demo:

### Prerequisites
- Rust installed via [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- Visual Studio Code with Rust Analyzer extension (optional but recommended)

### Building and Running the Demo

1. **Clone or open this repository** in your development environment
2. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```
3. **Run the demo:**
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

You should see output similar to:
```
Hello from the Rust development environment!
Today's weather forecast: sunny
This demo shows that your Rust environment is working correctly! ðŸ¦€
```

### Project Structure
```
rust-workspace-test/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.rs          # Main Rust source file with weather demo
â”œâ”€â”€ .devcontainer/       # GitHub Codespaces configuration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ devcontainer.json
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml          # Rust project configuration and dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # This file
â””â”€â”€ lab.md             # Week 1 assignments

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Rust Not Found
If you get an error like `cargo: command not found` or `rustc: command not found`:
1. Make sure Rust is installed: Visit [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) and follow the installation instructions
2. Restart your terminal/command prompt after installation
3. Verify installation: `rustc --version` and `cargo --version`

#### Build Errors
If `cargo build` fails:
1. Check your internet connection (Cargo needs to download dependencies)
2. Make sure you're in the project root directory (where `Cargo.toml` is located)
3. Try `cargo clean` followed by `cargo build`

#### Visual Studio Code Issues
If Rust Analyzer isn't working:
1. Make sure the [Rust Analyzer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) is installed
2. Open the project folder (not individual files) in VS Code
3. Wait for Rust Analyzer to index the project (check the status bar)
4. Try reloading VS Code: `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ "Developer: Reload Window"

#### Codespaces Issues
If Codespaces isn't working properly:
1. Make sure you have access to GitHub Codespaces
2. Try creating a new Codespace from the repository
3. Check that all extensions are properly installed in the Codespace

#### Permission Errors
On Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS), if you get permission errors:
1. Don't use `sudo` with Rust/Cargo commands
2. Make sure your user has write permissions to the project directory
3. Check that Rust was installed for your user (not system-wide with sudo)
